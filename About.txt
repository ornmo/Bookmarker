This project allows Users to save Bookmarks and click on the link to go back to the saved page

It uses local storage to save the page details and store them in the Users storage and also dynamically saves the favicons that go with the saved sites details too

Users can select the Add Bookmark which launches a modal and the User can save the site details directly. 

Users don't need to add the https:// or the www. this is done through the modal.

Bookmarks can easily be deleted. 

The project is mobile responsive too.
